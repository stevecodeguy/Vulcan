## Project Installation, Building and Submission Instructions

**IMPORTANT:** Please follow both the install and the submission instructions fully. Failure to do so will result in development errors, build errors, project submission errors and loss of marks for not following instructions.

Don't be a cowboy coder. Read and follow the below instructions.

## Install Instructions

The following instructions, assume you have already installed, Node.js, Git and / or the GitHub Desktop application on your computer system. 

- [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Install the GitHub Desktop Application](https://desktop.github.com/)

To install this project do the following:

### 1. Clone this Repo

### Option 1 - Using the GitHub Desktop Application

<ol>
  <li>Open the GitHub desktop application
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Note:</strong> If you haven't already done so, make sure to sign in to your GitHub account from within the application. You can do so by going to "Github > Preferences" on the Mac app or "File > Options" on the Windows app</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Clone this repo by going to "File > Clone Repository" from within the application</li>
  <li>Select the "GitHub.com" tab and find this repo from the list of repos listed</li>
  <li>Before clicking the "Clone" button, first select a location on your computer where you want to store this repository by clicking the "Choose" button
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Important: </strong>Do <strong>NOT</strong> store this repo inside a cloud drive such as Dropbox, Google Drive, Sharefile or One Drive. Doing so will cause errors. Remember your code will be backed up to GitHub in the cloud, so your data is safe in the event that you loose a local copy of this repo.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

### Option 2 - Using the Terminal (Mac) / PowerShell or CMD Prompt (Windows)

<ol>
  <li>Click the green "Clone or Download" button located above this repo's file listings<br><br><img src="https://res.michaelwhyte.ca/github-clone-download-button-with-red-circle.jpg" alt="GitHub clone or download button"><br><br></li>
  <li>Once the clone dialog has opened, click the copy icon to copy this repo's clone URL<br><br><img src="https://res.michaelwhyte.ca/github-clone-repo-dialog.jpg" alt="GitHub clone repo dialog"><br><br></li>
  <li>On your local computer open the Terminal app (Mac) or PowerShell or CMD Prompt on Windows</li>
  <li>With your terminal application open, change the directory to a folder on your computer where you want to save this repo. Enter the "cd" command followed by the path to the location where you want this to saved on your computer and press "Enter". Do not enter the "$" character. The "$" represents your terminal prompt.<br><br>
    <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
      <pre>
$ cd the\path\to\the\folder\where\you\want\to\store\this\repo...</pre>
    </div>
    <p><strong>Important: </strong>Do <strong>NOT</strong> store this repo inside a cloud drive such as Dropbox, Google Drive, Sharefile or One Drive. Doing so will cause errors. Remember your code will be backed up to GitHub in the cloud, so your data is safe in the event that you loose a local copy of this repo.</p></li>
  </li>
  <li>With your terminal pointing to the location where you want to store the repo, enter the git clone command followed by a space. Then paste in this repo's clone URL (copied in list item 2, above). Use "Cmd+v" on a Mac or "Ctrl+v" on a Windows machine to do this. Then press enter and Git will clone this repo down to your computer.<br><br>See sample terminal command below. Do NOT copy this command into your terminal, it will not work. Paste in your URL from list item 2 above.<br><br>
  <div class="highlight highlight-source-shell">
    <pre>
$ repos> git clone https://github.com/path-to-some-repo/do-not-copy-this-url.git</pre>
  </div>
</li>
</ol>

### 2. Install Gulp Globally

**Note:** If you have already installed Gulp globally on your computer for another project, then you can skip this step.

Install Gulp.js globally on your machine by launching the terminal app on a Mac, the Node.js CMD Prompt or Powershell on Windows and typing the following command and pressing enter:

#### Mac Terminal

```shell
$ sudo npm install gulp -g 
```
**Note:** On a Mac after entering the above command you will be prompted to enter your computer's login password. When you enter the password into the terminal nothing will appear to be happening. This is normal, just keep typing your password and then press enter.

#### Windows Node.js CMD Prompt or PowerShell

```shell
$ npm install gulp -g
```
### 3. Install this Repo's Node.js Dependencies

In the Terminal app (Mac) or the Node.js CMD Prompt or PowerShell (Windows), change the directory to the directory where you cloned this repo on your computer in step 1.

```shell
$ your-computer> cd the/path/to/your/repo/on/your/computer
```

With your terminal application pointed at this repo's folder, type the following command and press enter.

```shell
$ npm install
```

That's it! You have installed this repo and are now ready to run and build this project.

## Building Instructions

Most of your time will be spent writing the code to "build" this project. To build this project properly, please follow these instructions.

### 1. CD To Your Repo and Run Gulp

Make sure your terminal application is pointing at the root directory of this repository.

With your terminal application at this repo's root directory, enter the following command into your terminal application and press enter:

```shell
$ gulp
```

The above terminal command will fire up Gulp, which in turn will run BrowserSync for automatic browser refreshes on code changes and the Sass compiler for compiling Sass.

Once the above command has been entered, you can just write all your code throughout the day and Gulp will watch your files and compile Sass as needed. No further interaction on your part is needed.

Run this "gulp" command at the start of each day to re-start Gulp.

Don't forget to commit and push your changes to this repo up to GitHub throughout the day.

**Note:** There is no need to run a "sass --watch" command for this project. Gulp takes care of all the Sass compiling for you.

## Submission Instructions

Follow these steps to properly submit your project. Failure to follow these submission instructions will result in lost marks.

1. Launch your terminal application and change the directory to the location of this repo on your computer
2. Enter the following command into the terminal and press enter:
```shell
$ gulp build
```
3. Step 2 will run the Gulp build command which will compile (Sass) and compress all your project's code files and copy them to a "dist" folder automatically. With that done, simply commit and push up the newly generated "dist" files to GitHub using the GitHub app or the terminal

Once you have completed the above three steps, that is it. No need to email your instructor. Your instructor will check your GitHub repo for this project and mark the files inside the "dist" folder.

**Note:** Only one team member needs to run the "gulp build" command.

## FAQ's

### Q. Our CSS files and our styles folder are not pushing up to GitHub?

That is the correct behaviour. Version controlling compiled CSS files will lead to constant merge conflicts. Not having compiled CSS files in the GitHub repo is not an issue because any team member can easily regenerate the compiled CSS files by running the "gulp" command in the terminal.

### How do I install Google Fonts

The easiest method is to grab the "link" code from Google Fonts and place it in the head section of the index.html file of this project.

**IMPORTANT** Do not place the "link" code for the Google Fonts in-between the "css:build" comments. Doing so will cause errors when your run the project submission instructions. See the comments in the index.html file for details on where to put the Google fonts link code.
